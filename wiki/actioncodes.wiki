<b>Action code</b> is a integer number that allows communication between arduino board and host pc.

In the <b>arduino</b> code has two functions that separates the action value if the action comes with a value.

{{{
if (action.indexOf(ACTION_VALUE_SEPARATOR) == -1) {
 executeAction(action.toInt());
} 
else {
 executeAction(getActionId(action), getActionValue(action));
}
}}}

The project in actual version(r19) support the following action codes:

<b>Activity sensor:</b>

 * READ_ACTIVITY = 350 (not need value)
  # This action read and return 1 if activity was detected through the infrared sensor.
  # Returns {{{350=1}}} (if auto-notifying is enabled) case activity was detected.
 * ACTIVITY_NOTIFY_CHANGE = 351 (0 or 1)
  # Changes the flag to auto-notifying via serial that activity was detected.
 * ACTIVITY_NOTIFY_STATUS = 352 (not need value)
  # Value of auto-notifying status.

<b>Temp. and humidity sensor:</b>
 * READ_TEMP = 360 (not need value)
  # Returns the temperature (in oC)
 * READ_HUMIDITY = 370 (not need value)
  # Reads the humidity (%)

<b>System actions:</b>
 * RESET_BOARD = 100 (not need value)
  # Resets the software
 * FREE_MEMORY = 100 (not need value)
  # Executes malloc function and return the free memory available after operation
 * UP_TIME = 120 (not need value)
  # Returns system startup time (same as millis() arduino function)

 * LOG = 210
  # Not implemented yet. Only prints the value.
